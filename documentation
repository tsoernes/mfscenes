OUTFLOW:
setOpenBound(flags, bwidth, "yY", FlagOutFlow|FlagEmpty)
This function sets open boundaries at top and bottom.

The string "yY" sets the open boudaries at both bottom "y", 
and top "Y". Using just "Y" will only make the top open.

bwidth is (i think) the width of the boundary, and needs 
to be defined before calling the function. In example 
plume_2d.py it is set to 1


INFLOW:
densityInflow(flags=flags, density=density, noise=noise,
	 shape=source, scale=1, sigma=0.5)
Init noise-modulated density inside shape

Scale: Force/power/speed(??) of plume. Higher scale gives 
higher density and higher velocity of plume
Sigma: Dispersion of plume. Higher sigma gives lower 
density, and higher velocity of plume

TODO: Figure out what the arguments for noise does. 'noise' is used when
creating a sylinder, which in turn is used as inflow 

noise = s.create(NoiseField, loadFromFile=True)
noise.posScale = vec3(45)
noise.clamp = True
noise.clampNeg = 0
noise.clampPos = 1
noise.valOffset = 0.75
noise.timeAnim = 0.2
